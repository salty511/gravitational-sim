# üöÄ Solar System Simulation with Runge-Kutta and GPU Acceleration

This project simulates the motion of planets in the solar system using **numerical integration methods**. It compares **CPU-based** and **GPU-accelerated** implementations of the **Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4)** algorithm to analyze performance and accuracy.

## üìå Features

- RK4 numerical integrator for solving Newtonian gravitational motion
- Fetches real vector data from [NASA JPL Horizons](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons/)
- GPU acceleration using [CuPy](https://cupy.dev/)
- Performance benchmarking between CPU and GPU
- Visualization of planetary orbits
- Simulation of JWST orbit

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy & CuPy
- Matplotlib
- Astroquery & Astropy
